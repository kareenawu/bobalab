## Overview:

- More explanations and changelogs can be found in the respective Scatch Games
- This is an iteration of the driving game / simulation for Gig-Virtual built in Scratch
  - Current objective is to now rebuild the game using Javascript
- Game is typing-based, and presents a series of pre-generated prompts for the 'driver' when they are on a trip
  - Two different companys, Company Red (A) and Company Blue (B)
  - Also have a leisure option to earn passive income
- Data is imported into the game via the game_input CSVs, with each column becoming a list which is iterated throughout the game
- Data is exported out of the game in a JSON string format in which the player must copy and paste into a Qualtrics text box
  - The goal for the JS version of the game is to bypass this restriction, and have internal Qualtrics variables be tracked instead of needing copy + paste
